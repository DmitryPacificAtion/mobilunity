			<h1>How to Choose a Guitar Amp</h1>
			<p>This one is actually pretty simple, as it really depends on just how big a venue you are planning to play in. For club dates and even small halls, today’s combos are well-equipped to deliver the power you need to be heard all the way in the back. If your goal is to have enough sonic firepower to fill a giant auditorium or even an open arena, there’s no question that you’ll want a high-powered stack with at least a 4 x 12″ cabinet and a 100-watt head. As a amp_headcaveat to that, some players still prefer a smaller amp – such as a Vox AC30 – for its specific tone, and then simply mic the amp and run it into the PA system (provided the PA will handle it, of course). Remember, a combo is an all-in-one unit, a head and cabinet are separate and usually heavier.</p>

			<h2>Which is best, solid state or tube?</h2>
		</columns>
	</row>
	<row>
		<columns small="12" large="8">
			<p>Here the traditional thinking is that solid state circuitry can produce superior clean power at a much more affordable price, while the scarcity of vacuum tube manufacturers today tends to make tube-based amps more expensive than a comparably powered solid-state amplifier. This has led to some interesting hybrids in which the basic tone is produced by a tube-driven preamp, while the power amp is solid state. Still, the majority of “serious” players will almost always lean towards a tube amp, though the attitude is changing as manufacturers turn out amazing new amps that are based on cutting-edge technology. In the end, choosing an amp with the tones you like, whether solid-state or tube, is the most important thing.</p>

			<h2>Speakers: Does size matter?</h2>
			<p>Different size speakers produce different sounds. Smaller speakers can produce higher frequencies than larger speakers, which is why a tweeter is small and a woofer is large. So in the real world, a 10″ speaker will generally produce a better “top end” than a 15″ speaker. There is also a difference between an open-backed cabinet and a closed-cabinet design. Which is why certain amps, like a 4 x 10″ Bassman with an open back will sound different than a 2 x 12″ Bassman with a closed cabinet. And even though speakers may be the same size, they can still have different sound characteristics.</p>
			<p>Many blues players swear by those old open-backed 4 x 10″ Fender amps, as they can produce a range of tones from smooth to searing. If you want a big rock sound, you’ll likely want to plug your guitar into a 100-watt head with one, or two, 4 x 12″ cabinets. One well-known guitarist preferred four 4 x 12″ cabinets, which may explain his current hearing problems. Today manufacturers can custom tweak their amps by combining a certain size cabinet with a certain size set of speakers.</p>

			<p class="float-right">The Randall Amplifier Company was founded in 1970 by Don Randall, a lifelong radio and audio amplifier enthusiast. Randall began working as a salesman for a radio supply shop after graduating from community college in Santa Ana, California. It was there that he began a business relationship with Leo Fender, who at the time was operating a nearby radio repair shop. Randall went on to serve in the Army Corps of Engineers, the Signal Corps and Army Air Forces during World War II. After the war, he took a job as general manager of Radio & Television Equipment, a wholesale distributor of electronic components, where he discovered that Fender had begun making a few lap steel guitars and small amplifiers in his shop on what is now Harbor Boulevard in Fullerton, California.</p>

			<p class="float-left">Orange was founded in 1968 by musician and electronics designer Clifford Cooper of London and opened premises at 3 New Compton Street in London's West End. Initially, Cooper used only the basement as a professional recording studio, the studio featured an IBC mixing console originally owned by Joe Meek producer of The Millionaires. The studio was failing to meet its overheads so on 2 September 1968 the ground floor premises were opened as a music shop, where in order to cover wage costs, Cooper sold his own band equipment.</p>

			<p class="float-right">Once The Beatles became tied to Vox amplifiers (a deal was struck early in their recording career whereby they would be provided Vox equipment for exclusive stage use), the quest for more power began. John Lennon's first Vox was a fawn-coloured twin-speaker AC15, while George Harrison's was a fawn AC30 with a top boost unit installed in the rear panel. They were later provided with twin black-covered AC30s with the rear panel top boost units. Paul McCartney was provided with one of the first transistorized amplifiers, the infamous T60, which featured an unusual separate cabinet outfitted with a 12" and a 15" speaker. The T60 head had a tendency to overheat, and McCartney's was no exception, so he was then provided with an AC30 head which powered the T60's separate speaker cabinet.</p>
